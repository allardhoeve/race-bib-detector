# Task 033: Refactor runner.py (index)

Split into three separate tasks. This file is an index only.

- **task-034** — Migrate runner.py dataclasses to Pydantic
- **task-035** — Split `_run_detection_loop` into focused helpers (TDD)
- **task-036** — Add docstrings and inline comments (depends on 034 + 035)

034 and 035 are independent and can be done in either order.
036 should follow both.

See also: **task-037** — broader Pydantic migration across the rest of the codebase.
