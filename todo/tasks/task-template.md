# Task NNN: <short title>

<!-- One-line context: which step/area this belongs to and key dependency -->
Step N from `todo_benchmark.md`. Depends on task-NNN. Independent of task-NNN.

## Goal

<!-- What this task accomplishes in 1–3 sentences. -->

## Background

<!-- Why this is needed. Reference relevant design docs, decisions, or constraints. -->

## Context

<!-- Write a short section on the context of the change. Link as much as possible to existing
     documentation instead of writing long prose. //-->

<!-- To avoid redoing work and coming to the same or other conclusions, write here short 
     conclusions on previous research that was done. //-->

<!-- Example: "In task 007 and task 008 we tackle other parts of this task (009). The tasks
     pertain to the UI and the DB, this task pertains only to something other." //-->

<!-- Example: "In previous research we've shown that connecting such and such module from
     pip is not a good fit, because of reasons A, B, and C. //-->


## Constraints

<!-- Write down here any constraints on the task. Remove if not necessary. //-->

## Design decisions (resolved)

<!-- Remove this section if not applicable -->

| Question | Decision |
