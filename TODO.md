# TODO

## In Progress

### Improve bib detection filtering
- [x] Filter detections where bbox area < 10% of white region area (implemented in `scan_album.py`)
- [ ] Filter overlapping detections - keep longer number (620 beats 6, 20)
- [ ] Apply substring rule for overlapping boxes
- [ ] Regenerate bounding box images after filtering improvements
- [ ] Re-scan existing photos with improved detection

## Backlog

### Explore facial recognition for photo grouping
See IDEAS.md for exploration notes.
