Album Cache + Forget Workflow (Draft)

Goal
- Support a central cache for scanned photos.
- Avoid storing raw directory paths in the database.
- Track albums by stable identifiers and human-friendly labels.
- Provide list/forget commands that only remove DB records (never originals).

Proposed Data Model
- New table: albums
  - album_id (TEXT PRIMARY KEY): opaque stable ID (hash or slug)
  - label (TEXT): user-provided subject label (optional)
  - source_type (TEXT): e.g., local_dir
  - source_hint (TEXT): optional non-sensitive hint (no raw paths)
  - created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- photos table
  - replace album_url with album_id or add album_id and deprecate album_url
  - keep photo_hash and cache_path

Caching Workflow
- On scan of local directory:
  - compute photo_hash from photo URL
  - copy file into central cache (cache/photos/<photo_hash>.<ext>)
  - store cache_path
  - store album_id (computed or user-specified)
- Prefer cache_path for rescan

Album Identity
- Provide CLI flag: --album-label "Boston 2023"
- album_id strategy (TBD):
  - hash of normalized directory path OR
  - user-provided slug

CLI Commands
- bnr album list
  - show album_id, label, photo count, created_at
- bnr album forget <album_id>
  - delete bibs, face detections, assignments, photos for album_id
  - do not delete cached files or originals
- bnr scan <path> --album-label "Boston 2023"
  - create album if missing, then scan

Open Questions
- Should album_id be a hash or a slug?
- Should cache writes be skipped if cache_path already exists?
- Do we ever garbage-collect cached files, or leave manual?
